          <h1 class="page-title">ABOUT US</h1>
          <p class="promptfont">Stephen B. Jacobs Group, PC/Andi Pepper Interior Design is a full service architectural and interior design firm founded in 1967. Over the years, they have completed a wide range of commissions, including high-rise condominiums, international hotels, boutique hotels, office buildings, and adaptive reuse and preservation projects. In many commissions, the firm has provided turn-key services, including architecture and interior design. The combination of architects and interior designers working together under one roof from day one facilitates a seamless integration of the two disciplines. The work of the firm has been extensively published and has won numerous awards for its design excellence. <br> <br>

            A core SBJGroup belief is that design excellence, combined with the highest level of technical know-how, produces a unique level of architectural service that is not readily available. This pragmatic approach differentiates the firm from its competitors and has made the firm uniquely qualified to provide Architectural Services for Owner Builders and Developers. Through this experience, the SBJGroup has gained an exceptional understanding of the total development process, from the real estate, economic, design, construction and marketing viewpoints. </p>

      <p class="promptfont">SBJGroup has specialized in Hotel Design from its earliest days. We were the originators of the Hotel Gansevoort concept and popularized the roof top as a new hotel icon. We designed a significant number of New York City's leading boutique hotels, including 60 Thompson, the Hotel Giraffe, The Library Hotel, the Mansfield Hotel, and the original Hotel Gansevoort in New York City's Meatpacking district, as well as the Gansevoort South Hotel in Miami Beach, and the Gansevoort Park Avenue Hotel.</p>

      <p class="promptfont">Historic preservation was an early focus of the firm. Over the years, the firm has successfully completed the renovation and restoration of numerous historic buildings, many of which have been listed on the State of National Register of Historic Properties. <br><br>

        SBJGroup was one of the earliest firms proposing to use obsolete mercantile buildings as rental and/or condominium housing. Our portfolio is full of numerous adaptive reuse projects of every imaginable building type including factories and mills, hospital buildings, carriage houses, stables, and office buildings. <br><br>
        
        Stephen B. Jacobs, FAIA, was an early advocate for using obsolete buildings as a housing resource. His projects have become textbook examples of how to develop the highest economic potential of an existing building while, at the same time, preserving its architectural and historical significance. This achievement was recognized by the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, when he was awarded the Andrew J. Thomas Pioneer Housing award. </p>

This has included low density suburban projects as well as large scale high-rise projects built in a dense urban context. <br><br>
         Our projects span the entire gamut of the housing industry from government assisted affordable housing to the most expensive rental and condominium projects in the city.</p>
