            <p class="promptfont">
              SBJ Group is a full service architectural and interior design firm
              led by Alexander B. Jacobs AIA, Jennifer Cheuk AIA, and
              Isaac-Daniel Astrachan AIA. Each principal has over 25 years of
              experience with the firm. Originally founded in 1967 as
              Stephen B. Jacobs Group, PC, Stephen B. Jacobs FAIA (1939-2021),
              along with interior designer Andi Pepper, set the benchmark for
              the design excellence and technical expertise for which the firm
              is known. Over the decades, we have completed a wide range of
              commissions, including high-rise condominiums, international and
              boutique hotels, office and educational buildings, adaptive reuse
              and preservation projects. In many commissions, the firm has
              provided turn-key services, including architecture and interior
              design. The combination of architects and interior designers
              working together under one roof from day one facilitates a
              seamless integration of the two disciplines. The work of the firm
              has been extensively published and has won numerous awards for its
              design excellence. <br><br>
              A core SBJ Group belief is that design excellence, combined with the
            highest level of technical know-how, produces a unique level of
            architectural service that is not readily available. This pragmatic
            approach differentiates us from our competitors and has made the
            firm uniquely qualified to provide architectural services for owner
            builders and developers. Through this experience, SBJ Group has
            gained an exceptional understanding of the total development
            process, from the real estate, economic, design, expediting,
            construction and marketing viewpoints. <br /><br />
            SBJ Group is the ultimate team player, and we have served as
            architect/interior designer, design architect, interior designer,
            and executive architect.

              Housing, encompassing low-rise, mid-rise and high-rise buildings
              as well as individual houses and apartments designed for private
              clients, are a specialty of the firm. This includes large
              scale high-rise projects built in a dense urban context, low
              density suburban developments, and everything in between.
              <br /><br />
              Our projects span the entire gamut of the housing industry from
              government assisted affordable housing to the most expensive
              rental and condominium projects in the city. Completed projects
              include The Encore and Hawthorn Park near Lincoln Center, Chelsea
              Green, 325 Fifth Avenue, The Edge and Level BK in Williamsburg,
              Alta LIC, wood modular affordable projects in the Hamptons, and
              Sutton Tower, a 850-foot supertall luxury condominium.

            <p class="promptfont">
              SBJ Group has specialized in hotel design from its earliest days.
              We were the originators of the Hotel Gansevoort concept and
              popularized the roof top as a hotel amenity. <br /><br />
              We designed a significant number of New York City's leading
              boutique hotels, including 60 Thompson, the Hotel Giraffe, The
              Library Hotel, the Mansfield Hotel, the original Hotel Gansevoort
              in New York City's Meatpacking district, as well as the Gansevoort
              South Hotel in Miami Beach, and the Gansevoort Park Avenue Hotel.
              <br /><br />
              Other hospitality projects include Hotel X in Toronto, citizenM
              Bowery, the world’s tallest modular hotel, and the recently
              completed Fouquet’s New York in TriBeCa.

            <p class="promptfont">
              Historic preservation and adaptive reuse have been a focus of the
              firm since its inception. Over the years, the firm has
              successfully completed the renovation and restoration of numerous
              historic buildings, many of which have been listed on the State of
              National Register of Historic Properties. SBJ Group was one of the
              earliest firms proposing to use obsolete mercantile buildings as
              rental and/or condominium housing. Our portfolio is full of
              numerous adaptive reuse projects of every imaginable building type
              including factories and mills, hospital buildings, carriage
              houses, stables, and office buildings. <br /><br />
              Stephen B. Jacobs, FAIA, was an early advocate for using obsolete
              buildings as a housing resource. His projects have become textbook
              examples of how to develop the highest economic potential of an
              existing building while, at the same time, preserving its
              architectural and historical significance. This achievement was
              recognized by the New York chapter of the American Institute of
              Architects, when he was awarded the Andrew J. Thomas Pioneer
              Housing award.

            <p class="promptfont">
              SBJ Group is committed to designing sustainable, efficient, and
              environmentally responsible projects. We have several LEED
              certified professionals on staff. The firm’s list of LEED
              certified buildings includes The Edge, a thousand unit development
              on the Williamsburg waterfront, Village Green, Chelsea Green,
              Emerald Green, and Hotel X in Toronto. <br /><br />
              Our focus on sustainability has been at our core for half a
              century. We were responsible for the installation of the first
              large flat plate solar collection system in New York City in 1980
              for The Printing House project, as part of the adaptive reuse of a
              former printing plant into new residential apartments. A HUD grant
              covered most of the cost of the installation. The firm received
              one of the earliest conservation awards for that project.
